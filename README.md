Cropland Change Detection Dataset

## Introduction
This dataset focuses on cropland change detection, primarily for studying and analyzing the dynamic changes of croplands in the hilly regions of Southwest China. The data is captured by the GaoFen-2 (GF-2) satellite, providing high-resolution remote sensing images suitable for tasks such as change detection and land use classification.

The dataset includes 1,276 pairs of bi-temporal images, each pair being 256×256 pixels, representing cropland imagery at two different time points. These image pairs reflect the changes in cropland conditions over time, providing users with essential data for time-series analysis.
